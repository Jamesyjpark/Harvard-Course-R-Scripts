# Harvard-R-Data-Science-Projects

The goal of this course is to teach students how to answer questions with data. 
To do this, we will learn the necessary skills to manage and analyze data with case studies. 
We will learn concepts such as exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, machine learning, 
and high-dimensional data analysis. We will also learn the necessary skill to develop data products including 
R programming, data wrangling, reproducible research, and communicating results.
